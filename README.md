Estimate RMS contribution of individual harmonic components / harmonic classes

By Parseval's Theorem, we know that the Fourier Transformation is Unitary - hence the RMS of a signal can be computed in the time-domain as well as in Fourier frequency-domain.

This small class extends the concept to the estimate of the RMS contribution attributed to individual Harmonic components
